# Map Tools

Map Tools is an online tool to assist with map-related tasks like geometry drawing and coordinate converter. It supports multiple projections and provides an interactive experience for users to visualize and manipulate geographical data.

## Features

- **Interactive UI**: Engage with the map using an intuitive and user-friendly design.
- **Geometry Drawing**: Easily draw different geometries, including Points, LineStrings, and Polygons, on the map.
- **Coordinate Transformation**: Effortlessly convert coordinates between various projections (e.g., EPSG:4326 to EPSG:3857 and vice versa) for accurate spatial analysis.
